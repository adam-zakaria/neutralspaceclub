You NEED to use static to serve stylesheets

<base href="/"> #Did not work
<link rel="stylesheet" text="text/html" href="/home/john/Code/blog/css/style.css">#adding text/html did not work I DID text instead of TYPE
putting text/html got rid of the error message...but then no request was being made
I'm not sure why there was an error message in the first place.


Just in case, I disabled cache on chrome network tab. Did this because I looked in the network tab and realized that I was getting 304s The HTTP 304 Not Modified client redirection response code indicates that there is no need to retransmit the requested resources. It is an implicit redirection to a cached resource.

"You have to check that file exist on server. I found the reason, because there are no file (or missing) when upload source code to the server. So when the css file not found, server returns html MIME type"


On droplet needed to do 
git clone https://github.com/adam-zakaria/neutralspaceclub.git (uses https)
instead of 
git clone git@github.com:adam-zakaria/neutralspaceclub.git

Responsive web design was difficult me to wrap my head around. When exactly do I want text to get bigger? I've positioned elements using margins, rather than margins. This seems to have been a fine choice.

w3schools is not the definitive source of web information!
I don't think I want responsive text size. Responsive text sizes makes sense if I want to keep the same formatting text on screen as the size of the screen changes. But this is not my priority. In fact, on small screens, the text can become quite small. 


Media queries specify width because when you have more length you just show what is further down on the screen...that is, what would appear if you scrolled

I'm going to ask myself again. Do I want font bigger on bigger screens? I could keep the font the same size and display more content.
