You NEED to use static to serve stylesheets

<base href="/"> #Did not work
<link rel="stylesheet" text="text/html" href="/home/john/Code/blog/css/style.css">#adding text/html did not work I DID text instead of TYPE
putting text/html got rid of the error message...but then no request was being made
I'm not sure why there was an error message in the first place.


Just in case, I disabled cache on chrome network tab. Did this because I looked in the network tab and realized that I was getting 304s The HTTP 304 Not Modified client redirection response code indicates that there is no need to retransmit the requested resources. It is an implicit redirection to a cached resource.

"You have to check that file exist on server. I found the reason, because there are no file (or missing) when upload source code to the server. So when the css file not found, server returns html MIME type"
